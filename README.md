# SimplyReact
A ReactJS boilerplate without too much boilerplate

The central idea behind this boilerplate code is to provide developers with a professional codebase that to a great extent limit the startup code required to create a react native project

# Why use SimplyReact
> Most existing professional boilerplate packages introduce a whole new learning curve ( For God's sake you should be solving my problem not introducing more)
> It provides as much generic code as possible giving developers a subtle launch to any React project 
> It makes use of the regular ReactJS library allies like Redux, React-Router, React-Router-Redux,Redux-Saga, Reselect, ImmutableJS
> It is designed to be extensible without any unnecessary server side code making the developer to extend which whichever Server-side language they prefer be it Rails, Django, ASP.Net(duuuh!!!) or Node(hmmmmm!! Delicious)
